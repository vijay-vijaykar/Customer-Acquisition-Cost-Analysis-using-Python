         ------Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis------

Problem Statement: 

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is a critical metric for businesses that want to assess the efficiency and 
cost-effectiveness of their marketing efforts. It represents the average cost incurred by a company to acquire a single customer. 
Analyzing CAC helps businesses optimize their marketing strategies, allocate resources effectively, and improve their return on investment (ROI).

The dataset includes the following columns:

Customer_ID: Unique identifiers for customers.
Marketing_Channel: The marketing channel through which customers were acquired (e.g., Email Marketing, Online Ads, Social Media).
Marketing_Spend: The amount of money spent on marketing for each channel.
New_Customers: The number of new customers acquired through each marketing channel.

Your task is to:

CAC values for each marketing channel.
Data visualizations illustrating CAC by marketing channel.
Identification of the most cost-effective marketing channel for customer acquisition.
Insights and recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies based on CAC analysis.

Process We Can Follow

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis is a critical aspect of business strategy where Data Science plays a vital role. 
CAC refers to the cost a company incurs to acquire a new customer. 
Understanding and optimizing this cost is crucial for sustainable growth and profitability.

Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis is a valuable tool for businesses to assess the efficiency and 
effectiveness of their customer acquisition efforts. It helps make informed decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies, 
ultimately contributing to the company’s growth and profitability.

---> Below is the process we can follow for the task of customer acquisition cost analysis as a Data Science professional:

 1. Begin by collecting relevant data related to customer acquisition expenses.
 2. Segment your customer acquisition costs to understand which channels or strategies are driving customer acquisition.
 3. Identify key metrics that will help you calculate CAC.
 4. Calculate CAC for each customer acquisition channel or strategy.
 5. Analyze and find patterns to optimize your CAC.
    So, the process of Customer Acquisition Cost starts with collecting data on customer acquisition cost expenses.

---> Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis using Python

     Let’s get started with the task of Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

     # import libraries and load dataset

      	import pandas as pd
	import plotly.express as px
	import plotly.io as pio
	import plotly.graph_objects as go
	pio.templates.default='plotly_white'

	data=pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\fujitsu\\Desktop\\PROJECTS\\Python Projects\\Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis using Python\\
                  customer_acquisition_cost_dataset.csv')
	print(data.head())

	data.info()

---> Now, let’s calculate the customer acquisition cost:

	# calculate the customer acquisition cost:

	data['CAC']=data['Marketing_Spend']/data['New_Customers']

        Here, we calculated and added a CAC value to the dataset, helping the company understand how efficiently it is acquiring customers through 
 	its marketing efforts and which marketing channels are more cost-effective for customer acquisition.

---> Now, let’s have a look at the CAC by marketing channels:

	fig1=px.bar(data,x='Marketing_Channel',y='CAC',title='CAC by Marketing_Channel')
	fig1.show()

     So, the customer acquisition cost of Email marketing is the highest and social media is the lowest.
 
---> Now, let’s have a look at the relationship between new customers acquired and CAC:

	fig2=px.scatter(data, x='New_Customers', y='CAC',color='Marketing_Channel', title='New_Customers vs. CAC',trendline='ols')
	fig2.show()

     So, the negative slope of the trendline in the above graph suggests that there is a tendency for channels with a higher number of new customers 
     to have a lower CAC. In other words, as marketing efforts become more effective in acquiring customers, the cost per customer tends to decrease.

---> Now let’s have a look at the summary statistics of all the marketing channels:

	summary_stats=data.groupby('Marketing_Channel')['CAC'].describe()
	print(summary_stats)

     By understanding the summary statistics, we can:

  -> Use the mean CAC values to compare the average cost of customer acquisition across different Marketing Channels. 
      For example, if minimizing CAC is a priority, you may want to focus on channels with lower average CAC values.
  -> Use the standard deviation to assess the consistency of CAC within each channel. Higher standard deviations suggest greater variability,
      which may require further investigation to understand the reasons behind the fluctuation in costs.
  -> Use quartiles to understand a sense of the distribution of CAC values. For example, if you want to target cost-effective customer acquisition,
      you might focus on channels where the first quartile (25%) has relatively low CAC values.
  -> Similarly, the minimum and maximum CAC values give you an idea of the range of costs associated with each channel, 
      helping you understand the potential cost extremes.

---> Now, let’s calculate the conversion rate of this marketing campaign:

	data['Conversion_Rate']=data['New_Customers']/data['Marketing_Spend']*100

---> Here are the insights into the conversion rate by marketing channel:

    	fig=px.bar(data, x='Marketing_Channel', y='Conversion_Rate', title='Conversion Rate by Marketing Channel')
    	fig.show()

    So, we can see that the conversion rates of online ads are better than all other channels.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Now, let’s calculate the break-even customers for this marketing campaign. Break-even customers refer to the number of new customers 
     that a company needs to acquire through a specific marketing channel to cover the costs associated with that marketing channel. 
     When the actual number of new customers acquired through the channel exceeds the break-even number, 
     it indicates that the marketing efforts are generating more revenue than the costs, resulting in a profit. 
     Here’s how to find break-even customers for each marketing channel:

	data['Break_Even_Customers']=data['Marketing_Spend']/data['CAC']
	fig=px.bar(data, x='Marketing_Channel', y='Break_Even_Customers', title='Break_Even_Customers by Marketing_Channel')
	fig.show()

---> Now, let’s compare the actual customers acquired with the break-even customers for each marketing channel

	fig=go.Figure()

	# Actual customers acquired
	fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=data['Marketing_Channel'],y=data['New_Customers'],
                     name='Actual Customers Acquired', marker_color='royalblue'))

	#Break Even Customers
	fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=data['Marketing_Channel'],y=data['Break_Even_Customers'],
                     name='Break-Even Customers', marker_color='lightcoral'))

	# Update the layout
	fig.update_layout(barmode='group',title='Actual vs. Break-Even Customers by Marketing Channel',
                  xaxis_title='Marketing Channel',yaxis_title='Number of Customers')

	# Show the chart
	fig.show()

      So, this shows a positive result of the marketing campaign as the actual customers acquired from all marketing channels exactly 
      match the break-even customers. If the actual customers acquired were short of the break-even point, it would have indicated a need 
      to reassess marketing strategies or allocate additional resources to those channels.
